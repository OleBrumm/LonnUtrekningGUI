Just a quick freetime project.

GUI applications is something I want to become better at creating
Currently only includes my personal rates, but will add dynamic rate functionality sooner or later.

                       ---HOW TO USE---
    In the leftmost input field, type in month of workshifts. This should be in the form of:
              MONTH - YEAR / MM-YYYY
    In the rightmost input field, type in the shift information. This should be in the form of:
              DAY - STARTHOUR - ENDHOUR / DD-HH-HH
            
    Press the "Legg til" button to add the shift to the shiftlist
    This will add the shift to the textArea under with the corresponding pay for that specific shift
    When all shifts are added to the list, press "Beregn" to add all pays for the shifts

    Finally your total pay for all the shifts added will be displayed at the bottom of the application.
